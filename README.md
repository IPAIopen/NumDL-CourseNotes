# Course Material: Numerical Methods for Deep Learning

This repository contains lecture slides for a one-semester graduate-level class on numerical methods for deep learning.

This course was first designed and taught by [Lars Ruthotto](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~lruthot/) at [Emory University](http://www.emory.edu) and [Eldad Haber](https://sites.google.com/site/ehaberubc/home) at [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) in the Spring of 2018. The course was last offered in the Spring of 2020 at Emory and the slides reflect this version.

## Scope 

This course provides students with the mathematical background needed to analyze and further develop numerical methods at the heart of deep learning.  The course is simultaneously geared towards science students, who may be interested/experienced with deep learning and would like to strengthen their theoretical foundation, and mathematics students, who may have a background in numerical analysis and who are curious about the emerging technology of deep learning.  The course primarily targets graduate students. However, parts of the material may be accessible to advanced undergraduate students. 

The ultimate goal is to implement a simple, mathematically sound deep learning code from scratch. This look under the hood will provide valuable insight into successful and well-tested software packages for deep learning tasks and understand their success (and failure).
